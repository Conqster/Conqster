## Game & Gameplay Tech Developer << Software Engineering

Hello, I'm Jagunmolu Oke (conqster), an aspiring game developer with a deep passion for tackling challenges in gameplay, AI, and physics simulation technologies. I primarily work with C++, Unreal Engine and Unity, and I'm currently expanding my skill in software engineering paradigms and computer architecture.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Game technology (simulation & rendering), memory management & optimisation.

- âš¡ **Fun fact about my nickname:** It started with "capacitor", a nickname given to me by my physics teacher for my excellence in class. Playing on that, I combined "con-" from *condenser* (another name for a capacitor), "q" for charge (capacitance), and "s-ter"from the video game *SpyHunter (2001, PS2)* , to create "conqster".
